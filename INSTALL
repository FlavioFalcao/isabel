ISABEL Compilation and Installation Instructions
===============================================

These instructions works under latest Linux.
They may work under Darwin.
There are parts that can be compiled under Windows XP/Vista.

Note: if you want to compile just a piece of code, it is mandatory
      to set the PROJECT_ROOT_DIR environment variable to point
      to the directory in which the ISABEL sources are located.

0) This step should be only done for Linux, Darwin, SunOS and other
   linux bases Operating Systems. Ignore it for Windows.
   Before attempting to compile, you must set the build environment for
   the ISABEL package.
   First, you must to create a directory for objects and distribution.
   "/usr/tmp" for Linux, SunOS and "/var/tmp" for Darwin.
   Type 'sudo mkdir -m 777 -p /usr/tmp' if you are in a Linux, SunOS system.
   Type 'sudo mkdir -m 777 -p /usr/tmp' if you work under Darwin.

   Type 'make devel' to install the required libraries and tools.
   A priviledged user's password will be required for this step.
   This step should be done only once (although repeating it causes no harm).

1) Type 'make' compile ISABEL.
   First time, a 'Makefile.user' is created, edit as your convenience.
   The compilation process is usually place at
   '/usr/tmp/WHATEVER/objects-Linux' in Linux systems,
   '/usr/tmp/WHATEVER/objects-Darwin' in MacOS systems, etc.

2) Type 'make distrib' to copy object and configuration files.

3) Then type 'sudo make install' to all binaries, and libraries you built,
   configuration and activities files and GNOME menus.

4) 'make clean' and 'make cleanall' removes as much as they can.


The command 'sudo make uninstall' removes installed ISABEL from the computer.
