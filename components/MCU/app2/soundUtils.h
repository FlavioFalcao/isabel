/* Description of constants:
 *
 * Npc - is the number of look-up values available for the lowpass filter
 *    between the beginning of its impulse response and the "cutoff time"
 *    of the filter.  The cutoff time is defined as the reciprocal of the
 *    lowpass-filter cut off frequence in Hz.  For example, if the
 *    lowpass filter were a sinc function, Npc would be the index of the
 *    impulse-response lookup-table corresponding to the first zero-
 *    crossing of the sinc function.  (The inverse first zero-crossing
 *    time of a sinc function equals its nominal cutoff frequency in Hz.)
 *    Npc must be a power of 2 due to the details of the current
 *    implementation. The default value of 512 is sufficiently high that
 *    using linear interpolation to fill in between the table entries
 *    gives approximately 16-bit accuracy in filter coefficients.
 *
 * Nhc - is log base 2 of Npc.
 *
 * Na - is the number of bits devoted to linear interpolation of the
 *    filter coefficients.
 *
 * Np - is Na + Nhc, the number of bits to the right of the binary point
 *    in the integer "time" variable. To the left of the point, it indexes
 *    the input array (X), and to the right, it is interpreted as a number
 *    between 0 and 1 sample of the input X.  Np must be less than 16 in
 *    this implementation.
 *
 * Nh - is the number of bits in the filter coefficients. The sum of Nh and
 *    the number of bits in the input data (typically 16) cannot exceed 32.
 *    Thus Nh should be 16.  The largest filter coefficient should nearly
 *    fill 16 bits (32767).
 *
 * Nb - is the number of bits in the input data. The sum of Nb and Nh cannot
 *    exceed 32.
 *
 * Nhxn - is the number of bits to right shift after multiplying each input
 *    sample times a filter coefficient. It can be as great as Nh and as
 *    small as 0. Nhxn = Nh-2 gives 2 guard bits in the multiply-add
 *    accumulation.  If Nhxn=0, the accumulation will soon overflow 32 bits.
 *
 * Nhg - is the number of guard bits in mpy-add accumulation (equal to Nh-Nhxn)
 *
 * NLpScl - is the number of bits allocated to the unity-gain normalization
 *    factor.  The output of the lowpass filter is multiplied by LpScl and
 *    then right-shifted NLpScl bits. To avoid overflow, we must have 
 *    Nb+Nhg+NLpScl < 32.
