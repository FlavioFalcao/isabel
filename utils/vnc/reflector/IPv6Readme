The IPv6_vncreflector is base on the  HorizonLive.com vncreflector version 1.2.4.0. 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/vnc-reflector/). It has been modified to support IPv6 
and IPv4 incoming connections and to connect with IPv6 or IPv4 vncservers

This changes has been done as part of the WP4 (application_development) in the the Euro6IX project 
(http://www.euro6ix.org/main/index.php) by Diego Andres Acosta (acosta@dit.upm.es) 
from the the Telecom Engineering School (ETSIT) of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) in the 
Isabel Research Team (http://isabel.dit.upm.es)

The main changes made were:

- When the vncreflector lost the conection with the server, the reflector exit.
- It Receive IPv4 and IPv6 connection at the same time.
- It will connect with IPv6 or IPv4 vncserver.
- It will receive IPv6 url addreess format in the host file ([IPv6 Address]:port)
- The reflector is compatible with the host:port format. If an IPv6 address
  is given in this format, the last part of the  will be used as port. 
- The executable file name was changed to IPv6_vncreflector.
